# Chapter 01: Why Data Structures Matter

Data is a broad term that refers to all types of information, down to the most basic numbers and strings.

The organization of data does not just matter for organization's sake, but can significantly impact _how fast your code runs_. Depending on how you choose to organize your data, your program may run faster or slower by orders of magnitude.

## The Array: the Foundational Data Structure

The array is one of the most basic data structures in computer science; it's simply a list of data elements.

The _index_ of an array is the number which identifies where a piece of data lives inside the array. We begin counting the index at 0. (Arrays are zero-indexed)

To understand the performance of a data structure, like an array, we need to analyze the common ways that our code might interact with that data structure.

Most data structures are used in four basic ways:
